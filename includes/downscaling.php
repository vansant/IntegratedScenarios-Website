<p>The raw climate forecasts have two drawbacks for use directly in this study. First, the climate forecasts are provided at a resolution of ? -km, which is too large for many 
local impact studies. Second, the climate models have known biases for particular regions stemming from their models. To correct both of these, we perform a climate downscaling
procedure to translate the information from the models to a finer resolution and to remove biases by utilizing an observational dataset. <br>
Here, we utilize three training datasets for the downscaling process: 
<li>4-km <a href="http://metdata.northwestknowledge.net">METDATA</a></li>
<li>1-km <a href="http://daymet.ornl.gov/">DayMET</a></li>
<li>US Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) Station Data</li>
<br>
The downscaling procedure followed here is a monthly Bias Correction Spatial Downscaling(BCSD,Wood et. al. 2002). In this procedure, the raw climate forecasts are
