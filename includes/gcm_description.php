Global Climate Model (GCM) ouputs were taken from the <a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"> Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project phase 5</a>(CMIP5).
The new CMIP5 experiments include several different future trajectories based on human actions called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Unlike previous emission scenarios that prescribed different rates of emissions as the basis for understanding atmospheric concentrations and future climate, the philosophy of the RCPs is to establish a range of changes in radiative forcing from which possible consequences (e.g., changes in emissions, land-use) can be derived. Here, 
RCP4.5, refers to the experiment where an additional 4.5 W/m2 is trapped in the earth-atmosphere system by 2100 compared to preindustrial conditions, which is a future scenario of moderate climate action. RCP8.5, refers to the experiment where an additional 8.5 W/m2 is trapped by 2100, a future with no climate action and high emissions.

For the Integrated Scenarios project, we considered the historical GCM forcings (1950-2005) and the future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (2006-2100).
