The <a href ="http://www.plasmo.ed.ac.uk/plasmo/pages/show_page.shtml?name=home">3-PG</a>(Physiological Principles Predicting Growth) Vegetation Model is a generalized forest carbon allocation model (Coops et al. 2010)
that works with any forest biome and which 
employs a light-use-efficiency based photosynthesis algorithm to simulate the change in net primary production as a forest ages. 
The model uses relatively simple and readily available inputs such as species growth tables, latitude, aspect, weather records, edaphic variables, stand age, and stand density to derive monthly estimates of gross primary productivity, carbon allocation, and stand growth. The model has the capacity for specifying thinning regimes, although the function needs further refinement. In recent iterations, the 3PG model has been linked to satellite imagery of canopy photosynthetic capacity to model forest growth across landscapes (Coops et al. 1998). 

Monthly weather data is used to constrain photosynthesis based on high daytime atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, subfreezing temperatures, suboptimal temperatures, and soil water deficits.

For this Integrated Scenarios project, 3-PG was run using meteorological inputs from the 1/24-dewg monthly MACAv1-METDATA climate data for min/max temperature,  
precipitation, downward solar radiation, wind velocity and specific humidity. The 3-PG(version 3) model 
produced  five consecutive 50 year simulations of forest growth for the decades from the 1950s to the 2090s with outputs of potential leaf area index, wood mass, and net primary production.
