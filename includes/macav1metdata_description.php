The <a href="http://maca.northwestknowledge.net">Multivariate-Adaptive Constructed Analogs</a>(<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2312/abstract">MACA,Abatzoglou, Brown, 2012</a>) is a statistical 
downscaling method for downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) from their native coarse resolution to a higher spatial resolution that captures both the scales relevant for impact modelling while preserving time-scales and patterns of meteorology as simulated by GCMs. In this downscaling process, MACA removes historical biases and match spatial patterns in climate model output. MACA is noted for its skill in downscaling daily data in regions of complex terrain utilizing a multiple
variable approach. 
The MACA method requires both GCM data and a training dataset as inputs to the method. Generally, the MACA method proceeds by 0) interpolating GCM data to a 1-deg grid and aggregating training data to the same grid, 1) removing trends in the GCM data , (2) bias correction of the coarse resolution data with the Equidistant Quantile Mapping (EDCDFm,Li et al., 2010) method, (3) downscaling with the Constructed Analogs spatial pattern matching, (4) bias correction of the fine resolution data, and (5) trend replacement.

For the Integrated Scenarios Project, MACA was used to downscaled daily outputs from 20 CMIP5 GCMs using the <a href="http://metdata.northwestknowledge.net">METDATA</a> training dataset. This daily data was aggregated to monthly scales and provided to the vegetation modelers for MC2 and 3-PG.
