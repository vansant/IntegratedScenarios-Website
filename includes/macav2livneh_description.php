The MACAv2-LIVNEH climate dataset refers to the use of version 2 of the <a href="http://maca.northwestknowledge.net">Multivariate-Adaptive Constructed Analogs</a>(<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2312/abstract">MACA,Abatzoglou, Brown, 2012</a>) statistical downscaling method ( for downscaling global climate models(GCMs) from their 
native coarse resolution to a higher spatial resolution) utilizing the LIVNEH meteorological (Livneh et. al, 2014) training dataset to provide the 
statistical relationship between variables on the coarse and finer scales. The most important differences betwen MACAv2 and MACAv1 lie in 1) the joint bias correction of min/max temperature with precipitation (to capture historical snow/rain relationships), 2) the addition of an interpolated error term in the constructed
analogs downscaling step (so that the coarse pattern match is exact) and 3) an extra trend removal step after coarse bias correction of precipitation in 
order to better preserve the GCM signal for change.

For the Integrated Scenarios Project, MACAv2-LIVNEH was used to downscaled daily outputs from 20 CMIP5 GCMs using the LIVNEH training dataset.
