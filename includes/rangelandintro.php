Millions of hectares of rangeland in the western United States (US) are now dominated by expanding populations of introduced annual weeds, such as cheatgrass and  medusahead wildrye. Fire rehabilitation costs on these rangelands continue to escalate due to weed dominance, but may be minimized through the use of short-term seasonal forecasts to aid decision-making regarding rangeland restoration and fire rehabilitation activities. <br>
<br>
To aid the efforts to establish native plant species that can persist under competition from non-native invaders, we have developed this automated web tool to make recommendations for
restoration activities. This tool utlizes: 
<li> 9-month climate forecasts from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center downscaled to local scales</li>
<li>climatic thresholds for successful seeding practices, soil stability and wind erosion for different vegetation states and planting treatments</li>
