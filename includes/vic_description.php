The <a href="https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC/">Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)</a> macroscale hydrologic model is a spatially distributed hydrologic model that solves the water and energy balance at each model grid cell and incorporates spatially distributed parameters describing topography, soils, and vegetation (VIC, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94jd00483">Liang et al., 1994</a> and updates). It takes meteorological conditions as input and simulates the components of the water balance, such as runoff and evapotranspiration and water storage in the form of snow and soil moisture. In VIC, the land surface is modeled as a grid of large, independent model elements (or grid cells) with sub-grid heterogeneity (e.g. elevation, land cover) handled via statistical distributions. For example, the model uses multiple elevation zones within each grid cell to provide a more realistic representation of the snow pack in mountainous environments. Similarly, multiple different vegetation classes can co-exist within each grid cell and are represented as a fractional coverage. Model parameters describe the rates of infiltration and baseflow as a function of soil properties, the depths of each soil layer and their porosity, vegetation characteristics, etcetera. A separate routing model processes the runoff and baseflow from each individual cell and routes the flow to develop streamflow at various locations in the watershed.

For this Integrated Scenarios project, we used VIC version 4.1.2(k,l) with 1/16-deg daily MACAv2-LIVNEH climate data for minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and wind. The model was run in energy balance mode at a 3-hourly time step with model output archived at a daily time step. Additional meteorological forcings (shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, humidity, and pressure) were estimated within VIC using the MTCLIM algorithms (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.03.003">Bohn et al., 2013</a>). The same routing model setup was used for both VIC and Noah.
